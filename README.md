Git Agent is under active development. Packaged releases and development checkouts may
differ; check the release you are using before relying on a newly added feature.

## Features

### Everyday Git workflows

- Open, clone, and initialize repositories; organize them into workspaces and repository tabs.
- Inspect staged and unstaged changes, stage or unstage multiple files, and create commits.
- Manage branches, tags, and stashes; configure remotes and branch upstreams.
- Fetch, pull, and push with configurable options, and set repository-specific commit identities.
- Edit `.gitignore` rules with line-by-line explanations based on Git syntax, without an AI call.

### History and change review

- Browse the commit graph, search commits, and find commits by changed file.
- Inspect commit details, file changes, and blame information.
- Compare the working tree with a selected commit.
- Open a dedicated side-by-side diff window with syntax highlighting.
- Create and apply patches, including patches for selected worktree files or commits.

### Branching and conflict resolution

- Merge, cherry-pick, revert, and reset commits.
- Plan interactive rebases with pick, reword, edit, squash, fixup, and drop actions.
- Continue, skip, or abort an in-progress rebase.
- Resolve conflicts in a dedicated three-way merge editor: compare both sides, edit the
  result, navigate conflicts, and undo or redo edits before saving.
- Request AI merge recommendations with explanations and proposed resolutions; keep
  control over which changes are applied. See [AI-assisted merging](#ai-assisted-merging).

### Repository tools and customization

- Configure Git Flow feature, release, and hotfix workflows.
- Add submodules and subtrees; configure Git LFS tracking and run LFS operations.
- Use custom Git actions and repository performance diagnostics.
- Choose English or Simplified Chinese, light or dark mode, accent colors, and UI/code fonts.
- Extend syntax highlighting with [data-only language plugins](docs/syntax-plugins.md).

## Plugins

Plugins require Git Agent 2.0.0 or later. The 2.0.0 installer includes GitHub plugin 0.1.0.

### Plugin list

Plugins developed by the maintainer and contributed by the community share this list. Each entry contains only a plugin name and its repository address. Features, supported platforms, dependencies and release packages are documented in the plugin's own repository.

<!-- plugin-list:start -->
| Plugin | Repository |
| --- | --- |
| GitHub | https://github.com/adoin/git-agent-plugin-template |
<!-- plugin-list:end -->

The [website plugin list](https://git-agent.emssion.com/#plugins) is generated from this table.

### Use a listed plugin

1. Open its repository and read the installation instructions, supported Git Agent version and dependencies.
2. Download the `.gaplugin` release package for your operating system and architecture. Follow the repository's checksum instructions when a `.sha256` file is provided.
3. In Git Agent, open **Options → Plugins → Install / update plugin package** and import the package. Updates activate after restarting the application.
4. Manage the global switch in **Options → Plugins**, or override it for a repository in **Repository Settings → Plugins**. Repository matching conditions and plugin dependencies still apply.

The bundled GitHub plugin requires GitHub CLI (`gh`) and `gh auth login`. You can disable or uninstall it; an uninstalled bundled plugin is not forced back on subsequent launches. See the [installation guide](docs/plugin-installation.en.md) for details.

### Develop your own plugin

Create your repository with **Use this template** in [git-agent-plugin-template](https://github.com/adoin/git-agent-plugin-template), then clone your new repository locally. The default project is the full GitHub plugin; initialize the minimal example inside the repository to start an independent plugin:

```powershell
pwsh.exe -NoLogo -NoProfile -File scripts/init.ps1 -Id my-plugin -Name "My plugin" -Example minimal
```

On Linux or macOS, use `python3 scripts/plugin.py init my-plugin --name "My plugin" --example minimal`. Implement business logic and declarative UI in `src`, register pages, commands and hooks in `plugin.json`, and provide dictionaries and icons in `locales` and `assets`. Run the template's tests and development script, then build `.gaplugin` packages with `scripts/package.ps1` or `python3 scripts/plugin.py package`. Publish those packages in your own repository and document installation there. The [template guide](https://github.com/adoin/git-agent-plugin-template/blob/main/README.en.md) and [host SDK guide](docs/plugin-development.md) explain development, testing and packaging.

### Share your plugin

Open a PR against this repository's `main` branch and add one row to the **Plugin list** table in `README.md`. Only the plugin name and an HTTPS repository address are needed:

```markdown
| My plugin | https://github.com/you/my-plugin |
```

You do not need to submit plugin code or binaries here, or edit the Chinese README or website. After merging the PR, the maintainer runs `python website/build_plugins.py` and deploys the website to synchronize both lists. Plugin releases and updates remain in their own repositories; listing a plugin does not automatically bundle or install it.

## Download and install

Choose the installer for your system from the
[latest GitHub release](https://github.com/adoin/git-Agent/releases/latest).
You do **not** need Rust or PowerShell to use the packaged application.

| Platform | Release package | Installation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Windows x64 | `GitAgentSetup-v<version>.exe` | Run the installer and choose an installation folder. |
| macOS, Apple Silicon and Intel | `GitAgent-<version>-macOS.dmg` | Open the disk image and drag **Git Agent.app** to **Applications**. |
| Linux, Debian/Ubuntu amd64 | `GitAgent_<version>_amd64.deb` | Open the package with your software installer, or install it with `apt`. |

The macOS release is a universal build. Linux releases currently provide a Debian package;
other distributions can [build from source](#build-from-source), with the corresponding
native development libraries installed.

For a downloaded Debian package, substitute its actual filename:

```sh
sudo apt install "./GitAgent_<version>_amd64.deb"
```

### Runtime requirements

- **Git must be installed and available on `PATH`.** Git Agent invokes your system Git;
  the installers do not bundle it. Check with `git --version`.
- Configure SSH or an HTTPS credential helper for authenticated remote operations.
  Being signed in to GitHub in a browser does not configure Git authentication.
- Install Git LFS separately if you use LFS features. Subtree operations require
  `git subtree` to be available in your Git installation.
- On Linux, run the app in a graphical desktop session. Saving AI credentials also
  requires an available, unlocked Secret Service-compatible keyring.

The current macOS packaging script uses ad-hoc signing, not Developer ID notarization.
If macOS blocks a downloaded build, verify its source and consult
[Apple's guidance on opening downloaded apps](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102445).
Do not disable system-wide security checks to launch it.

## Getting started

1. Launch Git Agent and open an existing repository, clone a remote, or initialize a new one.
2. Review the repository's commit identity and remote configuration before your first commit
   or push. Remote credentials use your Git/SSH setup.
3. In **Workspace**, select a changed file to inspect its diff, stage the changes you want,
   enter a commit message, and commit.
4. Use **History** to explore the graph and inspect past changes, or **Search** to find commits.
5. If a merge or rebase stops on conflicts, open the merge editor for a conflicted file,
   review the result, and save it. Resolve the remaining files before completing the operation.

Normal Git workflows do not require an AI model. Try unfamiliar or destructive operations
in a disposable test repository before using them on important work.

## AI commit messages (1.4.1+)

In the workspace commit panel, hover over **AI generate** to see the current model
and data-sharing notice; click once to start using the model selected in **Settings → AI**. Choose
**Commit message language → English / Chinese** there independently of the interface language. Stage the
changes first. The assistant describes business-level changes with a conventional
commit subject and numbered details, and can read related files and search symbol
references beyond the changed files.

All code comes from a fixed index-tree snapshot, including unchanged tracked files;
unstaged edits and untracked files are not included. The generated message replaces
the commit editor text directly, with no separate preview or apply step. Edits you
make while generation is running are preserved. Review the message before committing;
generation never commits or pushes. Changes to the index or HEAD invalidate the
result. Amend and rebase workflows
are not supported by this entry point yet. Oversized diffs fail explicitly rather
than silently summarizing only part of a commit.

Staged diffs and requested context are sent to your configured provider, which may
charge for calls. Common sensitive filenames are blocked, but this is not a secret
scanner: review staged content before sending. AI descriptions still need human review.

## AI-assisted merging

AI is an optional aid to reviewing conflicts, not an unattended merge service.

1. Open **Settings → AI** in the main application and add a model configuration.
2. Select the API format, enter the provider's base URL, API key, and model ID, and test
   the connection. OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions and Claude-compatible Messages
   formats are supported; the provider/model must support the structured tool calls
   used by the merge assistant.
3. Open a conflicted file in the merge editor, choose a configured model, and request analysis.
4. Review the explanations and proposed changes, apply the ones you accept, and inspect
   the resulting code before saving. Run your project's tests before completing the merge.

**New in v1.4.0:** use **Apply all suggestions** next to the AI analysis button to apply all
actionable suggestions in one undoable step. Manual-only advice remains for review, and
stale or conflicting edits reject the entire batch. Applying suggestions does not save the
file automatically; inspect the result before saving.

### Privacy and credentials

Analysis can send file contents, conflict context, related source files, and Git history to
the configured model provider. Check the provider's data policy and your repository's rules
before analyzing private code. Provider usage charges may apply.

API keys are encrypted in the local configuration using a key stored in the operating
system's credential store. That does not anonymize the source code sent for analysis.
Do not share configuration files or diagnostic logs without reviewing and redacting them.

## Build from source

Install Git, a current stable Rust toolchain, and the native prerequisites for your platform.
See the [contributor setup guide](CONTRIBUTING.md#development-prerequisites) for macOS,
Linux, and Windows instructions.

The basic development workflow is the same in macOS/Linux terminals and Windows PowerShell:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/adoin/git-Agent.git
cd git-Agent
cargo build --locked --bins
cargo run --locked --bin git-agent
```

Build all binaries first: the main application launches the diff and merge tools as sibling
executables. Running only `cargo run --bin git-agent` on a fresh checkout does not build them.

For an optimized build:

```sh
cargo build --release --locked --bins
```

The output directory is `target/release/` (`target/debug/` for development builds):

| Binary | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `git-agent` | Main desktop application |
| `git-agent-diff` | Standalone side-by-side diff viewer |
| `git-agent-merge` | Standalone three-way merge editor |

Windows binaries have the `.exe` suffix. Keep the three binaries together when running
outside Cargo. For tests, the optional Windows watcher, standalone tool examples, and
packaging, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Configuration and themes

Application settings and repository-tab state are stored locally:

| Platform | Settings directory |
| --- | --- |
| Windows | `data/` beside the executable; installed builds use `<install folder>/data/` |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/Git Agent/` |
| Linux | `$XDG_DATA_HOME/git-agent/`, or `~/.local/share/git-agent/` when unset |

These paths describe application settings. Diagnostic logs and syntax plugins currently
use a separate `data/` directory beside the executable, including on macOS and Linux.
See [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) for the implications on installed builds.

Appearance can be changed in Settings. For custom palettes, the application starts with the
embedded [theme.json](theme.json) and overlays the first valid external theme found through:

1. The `GIT_AGENT_THEME` environment variable.
2. A file beside the executable.
3. A file in the current working directory.

Place a `theme.local.json` beside that external theme file to override only selected tokens.
The repository-root `theme.local.json` is ignored by Git. Restart the app after editing theme
files. On macOS, prefer an external theme file over modifying the installed app bundle.

## Troubleshooting

- **Git or authentication fails:** check `git --version`, then try the failing Git operation
  in a terminal in the same repository. Review your Git credential helper or SSH configuration.
- **The diff or merge window does not open:** make sure all three binaries are present in
  the same directory. For a source checkout, rerun `cargo build --locked --bins`.
- **AI settings cannot be saved or decrypted:** check that your OS credential store is
  available and unlocked. Copying `config.json` to another machine does not copy its encryption key.
- **macOS/Linux logs are missing:** diagnostics currently attempt to write to `data/` beside
  the executable, which may not be writable in an installed application. For a reproducible
  report, use a source build in a writable checkout; its logs are under `target/debug/data/`.
- **Windows rebuild fails because an executable is in use:** close the app, diff viewer,
  and merge editor before building. The optional Windows development watcher handles restart.

When [reporting an issue](https://github.com/adoin/git-Agent/issues), include your OS and
architecture, app version, Git version, reproduction steps, and expected/actual behavior.
Use a small test repository when possible. Remove credentials, private URLs, and proprietary
code from screenshots and logs before posting them.
