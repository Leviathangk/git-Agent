# Git Agent website

Static, bilingual product site for **https://git-agent.emssion.com/**.
No framework, build dependency, analytics, account, or backend is required.

## Local preview

From the repository root:

```sh
python -m http.server 4173 --bind 127.0.0.1 --directory website/public
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:4173`. On systems where Python is named `python3`, use that instead.

The default language is Simplified Chinese. The language button switches to English;
`?lang=en` and `?lang=zh` are shareable overrides. Only the language preference is stored locally.

## Downloads

All download links work without JavaScript and lead to GitHub's latest release page.
On page load, the site makes one anonymous, read-only request to GitHub's public release API.
When successful, the platform links point to the latest matching release assets. Requests
time out after six seconds; offline, rate-limited, and invalid responses preserve the release-page fallback.
No GitHub token is stored or sent. There is no polling or automatic download.

GitHub receives the visitor's normal network request when release metadata is loaded.
If that request is blocked, the release-page links remain available.

Product visuals must be actual application screenshots supplied by the maintainer.
The page logos, SVG favicon, and `/favicon.ico` are generated from
`assets/icons/logo-ga.svg` by `scripts/generate-brand-icons.cjs` (Node.js with `sharp`).
After changing that source, regenerate all icon resources and bump the logo query
version in `public/index.html` and `build_changelog.py` to refresh browser caches.

Do not reconstruct application windows, fabricate commit histories, or simulate AI results
as product demonstrations. The four PNGs are byte-for-byte copies of the maintainer's
captures; do not redraw, recolor, or crop their contents:

| Original | Public asset | Placement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `2.png` | `assets/history.png` | Main history showcase |
| `1.png` | `assets/workspace.png` | Workspace and diff |
| `4.png` | `assets/merge-dark.png` | AI merge, default dark capture |
| `3.png` | `assets/merge-light.png` | Alternate light capture |

Images retain their original proportions. Clicking opens an accessible native dialog;
Escape, the close button, or the backdrop dismisses it and returns focus to the image link.
The original-image link supports full-resolution viewing. With JavaScript disabled,
the images link directly to their originals and a separate link exposes the light capture.
The theme buttons switch screenshots, not the captured application state. The AI results
belong to those actual test runs and do not promise identical future model output.

## Deployment

Before publishing, run `python website/build_changelog.py` from the repository root.
Also run `python website/build_plugins.py`: the Plugin list table in the English
`README.md` is the only catalog source. Each row contains a plugin name and an HTTPS
repository URL. The script updates the Chinese README table and the static homepage
list; contributors only edit `README.md`, not generated website output. After merging
a listing PR, regenerate and deploy `public/` to publish the updated catalog. Plugin
features, dependencies and release artifacts remain in the listed repositories.
Edit `CHANGELOG.md` and `CHANGELOG.zh-CN.md` together; the generated
`public/changelog.html` is committed with the site so deployments need no Markdown
renderer. Use explicit version numbers and dates, not an Unreleased section or placeholder.
For each release, update both sources, rebuild, deploy the website, and verify the live
changelog in both languages. A pushed tag alone does not mean installers are published:
confirm the release workflow succeeded and GitHub Release assets exist before reporting
the download as available. Report any build failure explicitly.
The website navigation links to the matching language; without JavaScript the page
shows both languages in full.

The existing Caddy service hosts this domain separately from the server's other sites.
Public files live in versioned directories under `/srv/git-agent-site/releases/`, with
`/srv/git-agent-site/current` pointing to the active version. The Caddy configuration
imports `/etc/caddy/sites/git-agent.caddy` from the existing Caddyfile.

`deploy/git-agent.caddy` is the domain-specific configuration. Deploy only `public/`,
never the repository root or SSH credentials. Validate the combined Caddy configuration
before reloading the service. Keep the previous release and Caddyfile backup for rollback.

Use the existing authenticated SSH configuration on the maintainer's machine; no credentials
belong in this directory. HTTPS certificates are managed and renewed by Caddy.

On the initial deployment, the in-app browser successfully loaded HTTPS and the server
returned HTTP 200 with a valid certificate. A separate direct network test returned an
Alibaba Cloud `Non-compliance ICP Filing` page for HTTP and a reset for HTTPS. Check the
domain's filing/access status with the hosting provider; do not assume a successful test
from one network proves reachability for all visitors.

## Checks

```sh
python website/build_changelog.py --check
python website/build_plugins.py --check
node --check website/public/app.js
node --check website/public/changelog.js
python website/check.py
```

Keep website sources, checks, deployment scripts, and the generated changelog in Git.
Only local caches, environment secrets, private keys, logs, and temporary deployment
archives are ignored. Ignore rules are not a security boundary: deploy only the
reviewed `public/` output and never place credentials inside it.

Also verify the live page in a browser: language switching, FAQ disclosure, narrow layout
and mobile navigation, download destinations, and Ko-fi links. Confirm there are no
reconstructed product interfaces or simulated AI interactions. Keep live model calls out
of these checks. Also verify all four images, theme switching, original-image destinations,
dialog opening and closing, Escape/focus restoration, translated captions, and mobile overflow.

The Plugins section provides the catalog and installation, development and sharing
instructions in both languages. It needs no additional network request or JavaScript
to expose repository links. The catalog is generated as escaped static HTML; long
repository addresses wrap on narrow screens. Stable download links continue to use
the stable Release endpoint; the plugin section links to all releases so visitors can
choose a plugin-capable prerelease manually.
